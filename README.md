The creative aspect of theis project lies not just in its functionality but in its innovative approach to democratizing space habitat design. It reimagines a traditionally rigid, expert-driven process into one that is fluid, intuitive, and accessible.

Team considered a wide range of factors, primarily focusing on user experience, mission requirements, and technological feasibility. The goal was to create a tool that is not only robust enough for professionals but with functional requirements like diverse mission parameters, critical function,modularity, scalability, powerful 3D engine, AI integration.
